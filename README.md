# Masked-Face-Classification-and-Recognition-Using-CNNs-and-Transfer-Learning
This repository contains my full documentations of the project Masked-Face Classification and Recognition Using  CNNs and Transfer Learning

Nowadays, the mask has become the essential accessory to fight against the spread of the virus. Researchers

started developing a lot of Artificial Intelligence algorithms to
deal with the problems related to masks. Most of the algorithms
and techniques that have been released are related to whether
classification problems or recognition problems. In this project,
we developed our own algorithm of classification and recognition.
Our method will give us information about people who are
respecting the sanitary protocol, and will make it easy to
recognize people wearing masks. We developed five models that
will treat the classification of people wearing masks and not,
as well as a technique of classification of people wearing masks
by gender, and an algorithm that will allow us to recognize the
masked faces. In our methods, we used a model developed from
scratch using CNNs and a model using Transfer Learning to
fix the case of insufficient amount of data especially with the
case of the recognition task. All these models have been trained
using self-collected Datasets. The results obtained for the different
models prove the robustness and the reliability of our work.
